It integrates Firebase for backend services, providing features like user authentication, real-time database operations, and secure data storage. Users can sign up or log in with email and password, with persistent sessions to ensure a seamless experience. The app supports full CRUD operations, enabling users to browse plants, add them to their cart, place orders, and manage their data dynamically. Firebase Realtime Database ensures efficient synchronization between the app and the server for a smooth user experience.\n\nThe app comes packed with essential features such as saving favorite plants for later viewing, a recent items section to revisit previously browsed plants, and powerful filtering options for better searchability. The cart functionality allows users to order plants with ease, and their orders are tracked in the profile section. The settings screen includes a logout option and other user-related preferences, ensuring a comprehensive and user-centric design. State management is handled using solutions like Provider or Bloc, ensuring efficient handling of application logic.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the app follows a clean architecture with responsive UI layouts for compatibility across devices. Material Design principles are used for intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. The integration with Firebase ensures robust and secure handling of user data, while error handling mechanisms provide a reliable user experience. Overall, Plantify demonstrates a complete implementation of a feature-rich mobile app, highlighting my proficiency in Flutter and Firebase development.',
